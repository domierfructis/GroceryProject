This is my submission for the final programming
assignment in CS-21. This project uses the 3 java files
GroceryItemOrder, GroceryList, and GroceryListTest.
In order to start and test the program, run
GroceryListTest.main()

My program gives the user the ability to create their own
grocery list from scratch using a simple menu system.
Each menu options corresponds to a static method
in the GroceryListTest class.

Enter 0 in the console to view the menu options.
